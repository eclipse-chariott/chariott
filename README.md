## What is Chariott?

Chariott is a [gRPC](https://grpc.io) service that provides a common interface for interacting with applications.
Applications communicate between each other through Chariott. Chariott provides the necessary services to enable
application lifecycle management and communication between applications. This is done by having applications register
an _intent_ which Chariott will then _fulfil_ by brokering the communication with the appropriate application to
fulfil that intent. Applications which fulfil these intents are known as _providers_.

## How to develop with Chariott

Chariott provides gRPC interfaces to interact from a client application. The
client application can be written in any language that supports gRPC. The
examples in this repository are written in Rust, but the same concepts apply to
any language.

### Terminology

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application | As application we describe a client that is interacting with Chariott to lookup providers and interact with them through Chariott using intents |
| Provider | A provider is also an application and in addition registers namespaces with intents that it supports to the Chariott endpoints that other applications can use through Chariott |

### Concept of Intents

Intents are the main way to interact with Chariott. Once a provider registers
an intent with Chariott, other applications can use that intent to interact with
the provider. The intent is a gRPC method that is defined in the provider's
protobuf definition. That definition is only used by Chariott itself.

Chariott also provides a gRPC interface for applications to interact with
providers and delegates the calls based on the intent to the provider transparently.
Therefore, clients don't need to know the location and details of the provider as long as
their intent is fulfilled.

Here is a list of the current supported intents:

| Intent | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Discover | Retrieve native interfaces of providers. This comes in handy if you need specific interaction with a provider that you know is available in the system and you don't want to use Chariott to interact with it. This is also used for retrieving the streaming endpoints of a provider. |
| Inspect | Support inspection of functionality, properties and events using a simple query syntax. |
| Invoke | Invoke a method on a provider. |
| Subscribe | Subscribe to events of a provider. Note that this does not open the streaming channel, this is done through the native streaming endpoint of the provider. |
| Read | Read a property of a provider. |
| Write | Write a property to a provider. |

More information can be found in the protobuf definitions in `./proto`.

There is a separate document that describes the example applications and
scenarios that are supported by Chariott. It can be found
[here](./examples/applications/README.md).

## Getting started

For development and running the examples, we recommend using the
[Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) template
provided at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. If you decide not to use the
Devcontainer, refer to the `devcontainer.json` for a list of the plugins/tools
we use.

> Note: If you use Devcontainers and you are running on Windows, make sure to check out the
> repository on the WSL2 file system for better performance.

### Build all binaries and run tests

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

## How to run the examples and interact with Chariott

As Chariott's out of the box communication protocol is gRPC, the interaction with the
examples is done through gRPC. To illustrate how to invoke the gRPC methods we
use the [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) command line tool with the example application
**kv-app**. The **kv-app** is a key-value store that can be used to store
and read state. The state is stored in memory and is not persisted. It also demonstrates
the use of the `ess` and `keyvalue` crates.

This walkthrough is described in the [examples kv-app README](examples/applications/kv-app/README.md).

## How to run the dog mode demo

To run the dog mode demo, please refer to the [dog mode demo](./examples/applications/README.md).
